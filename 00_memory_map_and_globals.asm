; 6809 FORTH - 00_memory_map_and_globals
; Part of the consolidated build; every other split file
; depends on the constants and GLOBALS layout defined here.
; ============================================================

; ============================================================
; 6809 ANS FORTH - consolidated source
; Assembled from the full design conversation.
;
; GLOBALS LAYOUT: applied. Every scratch/global cell now has a
; fixed RMB-assigned address in page zero ($0000-$00FF, DP=$00
; at reset) - see the GLOBALS section below for the full layout
; and its byte budget (256 of 256 bytes used, 0 free - the page
; is now fully packed; any future scratch cell will need to
; reuse an existing one or move a cell out of page zero).
;
; SERIAL HANDSHAKING: RTS (hardware, output) is implemented -
; IRQH/KEY toggle it based on the input ring's fill level
; against INHIWATER/INLOWATER (see SECTION 3). CTS (input) needs
; no firmware logic at all: the 6850 hardware automatically
; inhibits TDRE while CTS is deasserted, and this system's
; existing TDRE-gated transmit logic already respects that with
; no code changes. Software (XON/XOFF) handshaking remains not
; implemented - this system still neither transmits nor
; recognizes those bytes.
;
; DICTIONARY: applied (SECTION 27), 219 entries (215 original +
; DOES> + TRUE + FALSE, added in later passes - see below).
; Every primitive with a real code label now has a real ROM
; header, chained via LINK, CFA pointing directly at its code.
; Building this surfaced two real findings, not just mechanical
; work: (1) the original 1024-byte BASEDICT could not hold the
; header table (1954 bytes needed) - BASEDICT was resized to
; 2048 bytes ($E000-$E7FF), taking the space from BASECODE (then
; $E800-$FFBF, 6080 bytes, was 7104). This resize was based on
; the header-table budget alone; the actual assembled byte size
; of BASECODE's code was never measured with a real 6809
; assembler, so whether 6080 bytes was enough for all ~530
; routine labels in this file was never verified before BASECODE
; moved again (below). (2) DOES>
; initially had no corresponding code anywhere in the file -
; SETDOES and the DOES> compiling word (code label DOESGT, since
; a literal ">" is not a valid 6809 assembler label) were added
; in a follow-up pass, alongside DODOES/DOESRT0, closing that
; gap; DOESBEH was added to the GLOBALS layout to support it,
; using 2 of the page's last 3 free bytes (1 now remains). TRUE
; and FALSE were added in a still later pass: CONSTANT TRUE -1
; and CONSTANT FALSE 0, the first CONSTANT-pattern ROM-resident
; words in this system (TRUEBODY/FALSEBODY, section 26) - every
; other ROM word's CFA is a plain code label, but a CONSTANT's
; CFA is the DODOES-trampoline pattern, built by hand here with
; fixed, assemble-time addresses since there is no interactive
; CREATE/CONSTANT phase for ROM content.
;
; BASEDICT holds exactly 1973 bytes ($D83F-$DFF3), an exact,
; zero-padding fit for SECTION 27's real dictionary content.
; BASECODE ($DFF4-$FFA1) is contiguous directly above it, sized
; to a nominal 8110-byte budget. BASECODE's end lands exactly
; one byte below INITCODE's start ($FFA2) - zero gap, zero
; overlap. USROMSTRT/USROMEND, INOUT, RSTACK, DSTACK, CODETOP,
; APPCODE, APPDICT, and APPVARS are all mutually consistent, with
; no overlaps anywhere in the current memory map. See the ROM
; Size Required section of the documentation and the open-items
; checklist for real content totals and remaining margin.
;
; This file preserves the code exactly as derived and verified
; turn-by-turn in the conversation, including the corrected
; versions of every bug that was caught and fixed in place.
; SUBSTITUTE is complete but deliberately scoped to a single
; registered name/value pair, not a full table (see REPLACES).
; ENVTABLE's /HOLD and /PAD entries, and the DPHERE/CODEHERE/
; VARHERE boundary checks, remain explicitly incomplete/absent -
; see the inline notes preserved from that discussion, and the
; open-items checklist.

USROMSTRT EQU $C100     ; Usable ROM start. Beginning of the usable
                         ; EPROM address range. INITCODE, BASECODE,

                         ; the previous $10000 definition
VECTORS  EQU  $FFF0
INITCODE EQU  $FFA2     ; was $FFA0, before that $FFC0 - now exactly 78
                         ; bytes, matching the ~78-byte COLDSTRT+WARM+
                         ; WARMMSG estimate with zero margin (was 80,
                         ; with 2 bytes of slack). UNRESOLVED: this is
                         ; a real, pre-existing overlap with BASECODE
                         ; (ends $FFBF), not something this change
                         ; introduced - $FFA0 already overlapped it by
                         ; 32 bytes before this change; $FFA2 overlaps
                         ; by 30 bytes - reduced, not resolved. See the
                         ; open-items checklist.
BASECODE EQU  $DFF4     ; was $E012 - shifted down 30 bytes so its
                         ; nominal end ($FFA1) lands exactly one byte
                         ; below INITCODE's start ($FFA2), resolving the
                         ; INITCODE/BASECODE overlap precisely: zero
                         ; gap, zero overlap. Nominal size (8110 bytes)
                         ; is unchanged, only the start address moved.
BASEDICT EQU  $D83F     ; was $D85D - shifted down the same 30 bytes as
                         ; BASECODE, preserving the exact, zero-padding
                         ; fit for its real 1973-byte dictionary content

                         ; with BASECODE's new start.
INOUT    EQU  $C000     ; was $DF00 - moved so INOUT (256 B) sits
                         ; directly below USROMSTRT ($C100), contiguous,
                         ; no gap. This also resolves the INOUT portion
                         ; of the collision flagged when BASEDICT moved
                         ; to $D85D: INOUT no longer overlaps BASEDICT
                         ; ($D85D-$E011), since $C0FF < $D85D. The
                         ; DSTACK and RSTACK portions of that same
                         ; collision were NOT touched by this specific
                         ; change, but were resolved separately when
                         ; those two regions moved (see below). This
                         ; move ALSO overlapped APPCODE at the time
                         ; ($7000-$D7FF then) - since resolved too, when

                         ; below; DSTACK moving up $200 closed it - now

DSTACK   EQU  $BCFF     ; was $BAFF - moved up $200. RESOLVED (both):

CODETOP  EQU  $B900     ; was $B800 - code space ceiling (data stack

                         ; matched DSTACK's true occupied bottom (was
                         ; $B700, a 512-byte mismatch) - now that DSTACK
                         ; moved up $200 to $B900, CODETOP matches it
                         ; exactly again
APPCODE  EQU  $7000     ; was $5000 - back to its original address.

APPDICT  EQU  $2000     ; was $015B - moved up, size unchanged (20133
                         ; bytes, now $2000-$6EA4). REDUCED BUT NOT
                         ; RESOLVED: still overlaps APPVARS below by 347
                         ; bytes ($2000-$215A), though SIBUF/WORDBUF/
