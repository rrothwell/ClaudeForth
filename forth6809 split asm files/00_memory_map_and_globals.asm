; 6809 ANS FORTH - consolidated source
; Assembled from the full design conversation.
;
; GLOBALS LAYOUT: applied. Every scratch/global cell now has a
; fixed RMB-assigned address in page zero ($0000-$00FF, DP=$00
; at reset) - see the GLOBALS section below for the full layout
; and its byte budget (256 of 256 bytes used, 0 free - the page
; is now fully packed; any future scratch cell will need to
; reuse an existing one or move a cell out of page zero).
;
; SERIAL HANDSHAKING: RTS (hardware, output) is implemented -
; IRQH/KEY toggle it based on the input ring's fill level
; against INHIWATER/INLOWATER (see SECTION 3). CTS (input) needs
; no firmware logic at all: the 6850 hardware automatically
; inhibits TDRE while CTS is deasserted, and this system's
; existing TDRE-gated transmit logic already respects that with
; no code changes. Software (XON/XOFF) handshaking remains not
; implemented - this system still neither transmits nor
; recognizes those bytes.
;
; DICTIONARY: applied (SECTION 27), 219 entries (215 original +
; DOES> + TRUE + FALSE, added in later passes - see below).
; Every primitive with a real code label now has a real ROM
; header, chained via LINK, CFA pointing directly at its code.
; Building this surfaced two real findings, not just mechanical
; work: (1) the original 1024-byte BASEDICT could not hold the
; header table (1954 bytes needed) - BASEDICT was resized to
; 2048 bytes ($E000-$E7FF), taking the space from BASECODE (then
; $E800-$FFBF, 6080 bytes, was 7104). This resize was based on
; the header-table budget alone; the actual assembled byte size
; of BASECODE's code was never measured with a real 6809
; assembler, so whether 6080 bytes was enough for all ~530
; routine labels in this file was never verified before BASECODE
; moved again (below). (2) DOES>
; initially had no corresponding code anywhere in the file -
; SETDOES and the DOES> compiling word (code label DOESGT, since
; a literal ">" is not a valid 6809 assembler label) were added
; in a follow-up pass, alongside DODOES/DOESRT0, closing that
; gap; DOESBEH was added to the GLOBALS layout to support it,
; using 2 of the page's last 3 free bytes (1 now remains). TRUE
; and FALSE were added in a still later pass: CONSTANT TRUE -1
; and CONSTANT FALSE 0, the first CONSTANT-pattern ROM-resident
; words in this system (TRUEBODY/FALSEBODY, section 26) - every
; other ROM word's CFA is a plain code label, but a CONSTANT's
; CFA is the DODOES-trampoline pattern, built by hand here with
; fixed, assemble-time addresses since there is no interactive
; CREATE/CONSTANT phase for ROM content.
;
; BASEDICT now holds 1992 bytes ($D83F-$E006) - grown from the
; earlier exact-fit 1973 bytes when H_ABORT/H_QUIT (formerly
; ABORTHDR/QUITHDR) and BASELATEST moved in from their own
; section so every dictionary header lives in one contiguous
; block. BASECODE's start ($DFF4) did not move to match, since
; it's a fixed address, not derived from BASEDICT's real size -
; this reintroduces a real overlap, 19 bytes ($DFF4-$E006),
; between the two. Not resolved here; see the open-items
; checklist. USROMSTRT/USROMEND, INOUT, RSTACK, DSTACK, CODETOP,
; APPCODE, APPDICT, and APPVARS remain mutually consistent
; otherwise, with no other overlaps anywhere in the current
; memory map. See the ROM Size Required section of the
; documentation and the open-items checklist for real content
; totals and remaining margin.
;
; This file preserves the code exactly as derived and verified
; turn-by-turn in the conversation, including the corrected
; versions of every bug that was caught and fixed in place.
; SUBSTITUTE is complete but deliberately scoped to a single
; registered name/value pair, not a full table (see REPLACES).
; ENVTABLE's /HOLD and /PAD entries were both added this session
; (HOLDMINSIZE and PADMINSIZE respectively - see the entries
; themselves for why each uses its own, conceptually correct
; constant rather than the numerically-equal PADOFFSET). The
; DPHERE/CODEHERE/VARHERE boundary checks remain explicitly
; incomplete/absent - see the inline notes preserved from that
; discussion, and the open-items checklist.

                         ; either way, so real content is reasoned to

                         ; and the 3-byte growth in content offset

                         ; the reasoning above holds; confirm on

                         ; $40 and $20 shifts, since both of those

; ANS transient-region minimums (forth-standard.org/standard/usage,
; section 3.3.3.6 "Other transient regions"), verified against this
; system's actual layout and used to replace the bare "84" that used
; to sit directly inside PADW with a named, documented constant:
;   PADMINSIZE  - PAD's own scratch region, size in characters. WORD
;                 originally used a separate, fixed WORDBUF that
;                 happened to meet its own 33-character minimum
;                 exactly (WORDBUF's span up to where SIBUF used to
;                 begin was precisely 33 bytes, confirmed by address
;                 subtraction) - but WORD has since been redesigned
;                 (see below, and WORD itself in the Header/Compiling
;                 section) to use this same CODEHERE-to-PAD gap
;                 instead, matching the traditional fig-Forth layout,
;                 so WORDBUF itself is retired along with SIBUF.
;   HOLDMINSIZE - pictured numeric output buffer, size in characters,
;                 (2 * n) + 2 where n = bits per cell (16 here) = 34.
;                 LTNUM ("<#") anchors HLD to PADW's own return value
;                 and HOLD decrements before storing, so this buffer
;                 grows downward from PAD into the CODEHERE-to-PAD
;                 gap, not into PAD's own region above it - confirmed
;                 by tracing LTNUM/HOLD. The gap must be at least
;                 HOLDMINSIZE wide for this to fit.
; PADOFFSET (below) satisfies both: it equals PADMINSIZE, which is
; itself well above HOLDMINSIZE (84 vs 34, 50 bytes of margin) - kept
; as a single, larger-than-either-strict-minimum offset rather than
; two separately-tuned numbers, matching "larger than minimum is
; satisfactory" for a small system.

                         ; it already computed against APPVARSEND
; SIBUF EQU $01FB retired - was interpreted-mode S"'s fixed, dedicated
; 32-byte scratch buffer; S" now writes into PAD instead (see SQINTERP,
; String Words section), which is both larger and correctly per-call
; rather than a single buffer shared by every S" call in a session.
; The $01FB-$021A range it used to occupy is left unclaimed rather
; than reassigned - APPVARS below still starts at its own, unchanged
; address ($021B) - to avoid any risk to the rest of this carefully-
; verified memory map for the sake of reclaiming 32 bytes on a system
; with headroom to spare; reclaiming it would need APPVARS to move,
; a separate, larger change not undertaken here.
; WORDBUF EQU $01DA also retired, for the same reason as SIBUF above -
; WORD now uses the CODEHERE-to-PAD gap directly (see WORD in the
; Header/Compiling section, and WORDMAXCHARS above) rather than a
; fixed, separately-allocated buffer capped at 31 characters. The
; $01DA-$01FA range it used to occupy is left unclaimed, same
; reasoning as SIBUF's retirement above.

; GLOBALS - real layout, applied. Every scratch/state cell
; referenced across the whole build now has a fixed address
; in page zero (DP = $00 at reset, set in COLDSTRT), laid out
; in RMB order below. Total: 256 of 256 bytes used - the page
; is fully packed. (DOESBEH and RTSSTATE were added in later
; passes, after this comment was first written with 253/256;
; they used up the last 3 bytes of headroom entirely.)
;
; SNEND, which appeared in the original placeholder list
; (documented under S"/."/SLITERAL/ABORT"'s string runtime),
; was dropped here: a full pass over every reference confirmed
; it is never actually read or written anywhere - SCNT/SPTR
; alone carry that runtime. CSAVE was removed earlier (see the
; COMMA/CODECOMMA history) and was never part of this layout.
